## Recurrent Mechanistic Models
This repository contains the code used to produce the results in the preprint:

  *"Rapid, interpretable, data-driven models of neural dynamics using Recurrent Mechanistic Models"*
  by Thiago B. Burghi, Maria Ivanova, Ekaterina Morozova, Huaxinyu Wang, Eve Marder, and Timothy Oâ€™Leary
  
which can be found in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.10.617633v2

The main results of the preprint can be obtained by running the scripts found in the "examples" folder.
Data used to obtain the results will soon be available in a permanent repository which will be linked here.

If you plan to use or adapt our code, or explore the ideas which are implemented by it, please cite our work above!
Please send any academic queries related to this work to tbb29@cam.ac.uk

The code will soon be released as a Julia package.
